**Problem Statement**
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation.

We have to reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.
